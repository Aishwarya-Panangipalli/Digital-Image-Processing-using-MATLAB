### Contents of the table: 
1) Read an image
2) Display the image 
3) Apply filter to the image
4) Display the image after adding image 
5) Save the newly obtained image

Here , Initially I have read an image into the workspace and displayed it using 'imshow' function. Then add a filter 'xyz' to the image and assign it to a different variable. By adding the 'xyz' filter the intensity of the picture is changed into a darker mode giving it a more aesthetic effect. Later display that image and resave the newly obtained image with a new name.
